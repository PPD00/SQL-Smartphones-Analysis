# SQL-Smartphones-Analysis

## Project Overview:

- Project involves the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing information about various smartphone brands, models, technical specifications and other key features.
- The analysis is performed using SQL(postgresql) to derive insights, identify trends, and generate data-driven recommendations.

## Objective:

The main objectives of this project are - 

- Data Exploration- Understanding the distribution and relationships between various smartphone attributes across different brands and models.

- Trend Analysis- Analyzing trends in smartphone specifications such as the adoption of 5G, processor performance, and screen resolutions.

- Correlation Analysis- Examining the correlation between critical smartphone attributes (e.g., screen size and refresh rate).

- Brand Performance- Ranking and comparing brands based on various performance metrics such as display quality, processing power, and battery capacity.


## Result and Insights:

1. The top 3 brands with the highest-rated models are Motorola, OnePlus, and Realme. These brands have consistently high customer satisfaction.

2.  Approximately 56% of the smartphones in the dataset support 5G technology. This indicates a significant trend towards the adoption of 5G.

3. Correlation analysis reveals that Oppo and Honor have a moderate positive correlation between screen size and refresh rate, with coefficients of 0.5467 and 0.5162 respectively.

4. Leitz ranks first with the highest refresh rate of 240Hz, followed by Asus with a refresh rate of 165Hz.

5. The brands with the highest RAM capacity and internal memory are Vertu, Cat, Itel, Lyf, and TCL.

6. The top 5 models with the highest screen resolution are:
- Sony Xperia 1 II
